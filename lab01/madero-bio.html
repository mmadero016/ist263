            <title>Maria Madero - Bio</title>
        </head>

    <body>
        My name is Maria Madero, and I am a junior majoring in Psychology and minoring in IMT. I recently switched majors, being that I used to major in Biology on a pre-med track. I realized I was not enjoying my studies and made the switch while adding the minor. Since then, I have been much more content with my studies and now have interest in digital marketing, data analytics – something within the tech realm. I have a younger sibling, and a first-generation college student. I am currently involved in the school’s Mexican Student Association as their graphic designer. I love to draw, often finding myself doodling during my free time. Being from NYC, I also love exploring and finding new things to do.
